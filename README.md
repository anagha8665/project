First created app named Gadgeon installed bootstrap. Created four components in it named Home,About,Contact,Service. Here we implemented angular routing. Angular routing is the process of navigating from one application to application.
For doing that we imported HttpClientModule,RouterModule and routes in app.module.ts.in 'app.component.html' we created a nav bar and added all components in it using routerlink.
